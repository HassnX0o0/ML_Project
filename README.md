# ML_Project
Simple Machine Learning Project That's Apply 4 Algorithms On Dataset:
    1. Decision Tree (DT)
    2. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
    3. Naive Bayes (NB)
    4.K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN)

The project include preprocessing & Exploration Dataset Analysis(EDA). It also has code visualisation and plotting to get some insights about the dataset.
